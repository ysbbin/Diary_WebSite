## 📔 Diary WebSite

**Diary WebSite** is a **multi-user, web-based calendar and schedule management service** designed to enhance personal productivity and support collaborative team planning.

Unlike local or single-user tools, this project is developed as a **public web service**, enabling users to manage their own schedules and optionally share calendars with teammates for effective collaboration on joint projects.
